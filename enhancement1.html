			By implementing RESTful endpoints in Spring Boot, I moved from a
			script-based approach to a more structured service layer. This is a key
			improvement in software design, showing the ability to design scalable and
			modular systems.
			<br />
			<br />
			In the original artifact, the dashboard was implemented using Dash, a
			Python framework for building analytical web applications. The translated
			project replaces Dash with React, which is a more flexible and widely used
			tool for creating interactive UIs. By breaking down the UI into React
			components, I leveraged a modular approach to front-end development. This
			approach not only makes the code more maintainable but also enhances my
			understanding of component-based architecture, which is a key skill in
			modern web development. The React components interact with the Spring Boot
			backend via API calls, demonstrating the ability to integrate a frontend
			with a backend using RESTful services and asynchronous data fetching
			through axios.
			<br />
			<br />
			There are a few improvements in software design as well. By switching to a
			Spring Boot backend and React frontend, I applied the separation of
			concerns principle, where data access, business logic, and presentation
			are managed separately. This improves the maintainability of the codebase.
			Furthermore, the backend now communicates with the frontend via a REST
			API, allowing for better scalability and flexibility. This makes it easier
			to integrate additional clients or services in the future, adhering to
			industry standards for web service architectures. Lastly, with React
			managing the frontend, user interaction becomes more dynamic. The React
			frontend, unlike Dash, can provide a richer and faster user experience,
			with interactive features such as live filtering, sorting, and the
			possibility to easily update data on the fly.
			<br />
			<br />
			The translation moved from a tightly coupled, single-language,
			single-framework solution (Python/Dash) to a more loosely coupled,
			multi-tiered, full-stack solution (Spring Boot/React). This allowed for
			the application to handle larger user bases, with Spring Bootâ€™s built-in
			scalability features. It also allowed for integration of modern frontend
			technologies for a more dynamic, responsive user interface. Lastly, it
			improved maintainability and flexibility by using a separation of concerns
			approach, where the backend and frontend can evolve independently.
			<br />
			<br />
			All-in-all, the process to modify the artifact was smooth. I encountered a
			small problem with my CSS file that I found a way to fix via the internet.
			Based on the enhancements made to the artifact, I have successfully met
			the course outcomes as originally planned for Module One by demonstrating
			effective planning, design choices, and the application of modern tools
			and techniques. The project is scalable, modular, and follows best
			practices in full-stack development, ensuring both the frontend and
			backend are well-structured for future improvements. Additionally, my
			approach to data encapsulation and RESTful API design further strengthens
			the overall design.
