			By adding indexes to fields like breed, ageUponOutcome, and animalType I
			demonstrated an understanding of data structures (B-trees in MongoDB).
			These indexes reduce the complexity of search operations from O(n) to
			O(log n). I also introduced pagination. By introducing pagination in the
			repository and service layers, the application avoids fetching large
			datasets all at once which improves performance and memory utilization,
			showcasing knowledge of breaking down data into manageable chunks. Lastly,
			the introduction of Redis caching stores frequently queried results,
			reducing repeated database lookups. This leverages hashing and
			memory-based storage to optimize read operations.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Improvements made to the artifact include:</strong>
			<br />
			Scalability: Added pagination and filtering ensures the application can
			handle large datasets without performance degradation.
			<br />
			Performance: Implementing MongoDB indexes and Redis caching significantly
			improves query performance and reduces latency.
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Pagination minimizes data transfer over the network, optimizing the
			application for real-time interactions.
			<br />
			<br />
			By implementing caching and indexing, the enhancement demonstrates
			proficiency in algorithmic design and optimization, effectively reducing
			query complexity and improving response times. These methods, combined
			with paginated and filtered data access, ensure the system can manage
			large data volumes efficiently while balancing memory usage, processing
			speed, and scalabilityâ€”key aspects of managing trade-offs in design. The
			use of modern tools like Redis for caching and MongoDB for indexing and
			pagination showcases expertise in leveraging industry-standard
			technologies to streamline data retrieval and improve performance.
			Additionally, asynchronous processing with Spring Boot supports
			scalability by enabling the system to handle high request volumes
			effectively. Furthermore, the enhancements incorporate a strong security
			mindset, as seen in its focus on secure data handling practices.
			Strategies like time-limited caching prevent stale data issues, and the
			restriction of cache storage to non-sensitive data ensures data privacy
			and reduces the risk of leaks. By architecting secure data access
			controls, the enhancements uphold data security principles, addressing
			potential vulnerabilities proactively. Overall, the enhancement showcases
			a well-rounded application of algorithmic principles, innovative tools,
			and secure design practices, meeting and exceeding the planned course
			outcomes.
			<br />
			<br />
			A major challenge that I encountered during this enhancement was
			integrating Redis caching into the application. Ensuring that caching was
			implemented effectively to reduce database load, while also handling the
			complexities of cache invalidation and maintaining data consistency,
			required a lot of attention to detail. I had to carefully ensure that
			sensitive data was not stored in the cache and that caching strategies
			such as time-limited storage were applied correctly. Additionally,
			debugging and fine-tuning the pagination and filtering functionality
			involved working with both Spring Boot and MongoDB, which required
			understanding how to best configure the database and repository layers to
			meet specific use cases. Working through these I developed stronger
			problem-solving skills and learned how to approach complex systems from a
			design and optimization perspective. <br />
