		<h1 class="title">CS-499 ePortfolio</h1>
		<h2 class="paragraph-heading">Introduction:</h2>
		<p class="blurb">
			Hello, my name is Rodriques Perry, and welcome to my capstone ePortfolio
			for CS-499 in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire
			University (SNHU). Two years ago, I embarked on this journey at SNHU,
			seeking a meaningful career change, and this ePortfolio represents the
			culmination of that effort. Designed as an electronic showcase, this page
			highlights my final project, demonstrating the skills and knowledge I’ve
			gained as I complete my Bachelor’s degree and prepare to graduate. Thank
			you for visiting, and I hope you find this work insightful and inspiring!
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2 class="paragraph-heading">Self Assessment</h2>
		<p class="blurb">
			My journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire
			University has been transformative, shaping my professional goals, values,
			and technical expertise. This ePortfolio serves as a testament to my
			growth and showcases my ability to plan, develop, and refine
			industry-standard code and software programs. While it does not encompass
			the entirety of my work in this program, it highlights key skills across
			Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and
			Databases—areas that are essential for building robust, efficient, and
			secure applications.
			<br />
			<br />
			Throughout my coursework, I have learned the significance of reviewing and
			refining one’s work to meet professional standards. This process involves
			optimizing code by removing unnecessary complexity, adding clear and
			concise comments, and expanding a program’s capabilities. For example, in
			this capstone project, I enhanced my artifacts by implementing testing
			modules to ensure secure coding practices, adding new functionality to
			support database CRUD operations, and increasing the efficiency of list
			search algorithms in an appointment scheduler.
			<br />
			<br />
			In addition to technical expertise, I’ve developed essential soft skills
			such as collaborating effectively in a team environment and communicating
			clearly with stakeholders. Working in teams has taught me the value of
			shared responsibility and diverse perspectives, while engaging with
			stakeholders has honed my ability to translate technical concepts into
			solutions that meet user needs. These skills are critical for bridging the
			gap between technical implementation and business goals.
			<br />
			<br />
			My proficiency in data structures and algorithms enables me to write code
			that is not only functional but also efficient and scalable. Paired with
			my knowledge of software engineering principles and database management, I
			can design and implement systems that are reliable and maintainable.
			Moreover, I prioritize security in every aspect of development, ensuring
			that my solutions protect data integrity and safeguard against
			vulnerabilities.
			<br />
			<br />
			This ePortfolio represents the culmination of my academic journey and
			showcases the technical and professional skills that make me a valuable
			asset to prospective employers. It is a reflection of my commitment to
			continuous improvement and my readiness to contribute meaningfully in the
			field of computer science.

		<h2 class="paragraph-heading">Artifacts:</h2>
		<p class="blurb">
			The artifacts in this portfolio showcase my work in software design and
			engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Throughout the
			course, I have refined these artifacts by enhancing their functionality,
			increasing their complexity, and incorporating comments to improve code
			readability and maintainability.
			<br />
			<br />
			Each enhancement in this portfolio highlights a project originally
			developed for CS-340, completed on June 23, 2024, which focused on
			building an interactive database for rescue animal centers. Written in
			Python, the project utilizes PyMongo to interact with MongoDB, serving as
			the backend for performing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
			operations on animal shelter data. This artifact demonstrates my skills in
			Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, and
			Database Management, showcasing how I refined and expanded its
			functionality across these core areas to create a robust and maintainable
			solution.
			<br />
			<br />

			This artifact was chosen because it exemplifies the transformation of a
			Python-based project with MongoDB and Dash into a more advanced full-stack
			web application, utilizing Spring Boot for the backend and React for the
			frontend. This evolution highlights my proficiency in software development
			principles and modern technologies, demonstrating my ability to refactor
			and enhance the project into a scalable, maintainable, and robust
			solution.
