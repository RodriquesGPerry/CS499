			The components I worked on for milestone 4 — indexing, data validation,
			and a polished UI—showcase several specific software development skills
			and significantly improve the artifact. Indexing improves query
			performance, showcasing my ability to analyze and enhance database
			operations for scalability. It also reflects my understanding of MongoDB
			internals and my ability to implement solutions for real-world data
			management challenges. Furthermore, by validating inputs at multiple
			layers (front-end and back-end), I exhibit a strong grasp of securing
			applications against common vulnerabilities like injection attacks or
			malformed data. This also demonstrates my commitment to maintaining data
			integrity and ensuring a robust user experience. Lastly, a polished and
			user-friendly interface shows my ability to create intuitive and
			aesthetically appealing applications. It highlights my skills in React,
			attention to usability, and responsiveness to end-user needs.

			While improving the artifact, I encountered a configuration issue that
			repeatedly triggered an error message. After investigating, I discovered
			that the problem stemmed from a version mismatch in one of the
			application's dependencies. The version I was using was incompatible with
			other components of the application. To resolve the issue, I downgraded
			the dependency to a compatible version and restarted my IDE to ensure the
			changes were fully applied. This resolved the error, allowing the
			application to function correctly. This experience highlights my ability
			to identify and resolve compatibility issues efficiently, showcasing
			skills in dependency management and troubleshooting complex systems. It
			also reflects adaptability, as I quickly adjusted my approach to meet the
			requirements of the development environment.
