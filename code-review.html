				A code review is a process where one or more developers examine someone
				else's code to ensure it is clear, correct, and efficient. Itâ€™s like
				having a second pair of eyes to catch mistakes, improve the code's
				quality, and make sure it follows best practices. For computer science
				professionals, code reviews are valuable because they help them learn
				from peers, share knowledge, and improve their coding skills. This
				process also boosts teamwork by encouraging open communication and
				collaboration. Additionally, code reviews can catch bugs early, saving
				time and effort later in the project. Overall, they lead to better, more
				reliable software while helping developers grow in their careers. You
				can view my code review below.
